# Docker and Kubernetes Dotfiles 😎🐳

Hey there, fellow coder! Welcome to the Docker and Kubernetes Dotfiles party 🚀. This repo is your one-stop shop for leveling up your Docker and Kubernetes game. We've got cool configurations, nifty scripts, and magical Kubernetes manifests – all to make your container journey smoother than butter.

## What's Cookin'?

- **.dockerconfig**: This is where the Docker magic happens! 🪄 Tweak those settings, set up secret handshakes (a.k.a. authentication), and get things running just how you like it.
- **.kubeconfig**: Fancy some Kubernetes action? 🎩 This is where you manage contexts, clusters, and summon your K8s powers.
- **.bashrc**: Customization station! ✨ Load up your shell with aliases, shortcuts, and a bit of extra pizzazz for Docker and Kubernetes commands.
- **bin/**: Utilities to the rescue 🦸‍♂️! Find handy scripts here for Docker and Kubernetes tasks that'll save you time and make you look super pro.
- **k8s-manifests/**: Our magical scrolls 📜. Check out these Kubernetes manifests to conjure deployments, services, and more!
- **go-scripts/**: Enchanted scripts in Go ✨. Delve into the world of Go with utilities for Docker, Kubernetes, and more!
